# SelfServiceStudentSystem
This project aims to create a self-service system for university students, allowing them to independently perform administrative tasks such as paying semester fees, obtaining transcripts, and verifying their student status. The system is built using ASP.NET Core with a focus on user-friendly design and functionality.
